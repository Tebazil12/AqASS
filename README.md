Aquatic Area Scanning System

A control system for a motor boat to make it autonomously scan a body of water.

This code is designed to be run on a motor-powered boat. The python code has been 
developed for a pi3, and the arudino code has been developed for a moteino, but this code will likely run on similar hardware.
